  <h4>How To Find A Good Breeder</h4>
  </br>

<p>Maybe you have read about rescue dogs and decided that you would like a dog, but
rescue is just not right for you at this time. Where, besides through rescue, can you
find a good dog? Pet stores that sell puppies are out of the question; the vast majority
of puppies in pet stores come from puppy mills, and buying a dog from a pet store is bad for
you - health guarantees? breeding records? forget it! - as well as for the breeding dogs
who spend their lives in misery so that the pet store owner and mill owner can line their pockets.</p>

<p>So how do you find a good breeder? Some people are surprised to learn that the want ads in
your local paper, where puppies are listed for sale every day, are probably not the best place
to start. Many of the breeders who advertise in want ads are people who have bred their pet dog
for all the wrong reasons: He is so cute and we wanted to produce more just like him! We wanted
her to have just one litter so she could experience motherhood. We wanted our children to witness
the miracle of birth firsthand. Genetics is a complex science and nothing to be taken lightly.
People who breed their pets may or may not have a thorough knowledge of the lineage of their dog
and its mate; they may or may not know what genetic problems lurk in the family tree.</p>

<p>Some breeders who advertise widely -- on the internet, for example--are just hoping to make some
extra money, even though responsible breeding of dogs costs more money than you will ever make.</p>

<p>And what about the many breeder ads that appear every month in national dog magazines? Well, the
volume breeders, puppy mills, and backyard breeders advertise there too. In fact, in a given month,
the majority of breeders listed in dog magazines fit one of those three undesirable categories.
In one issue, 35 kennels advertised dachshunds for sale; of those 35, it is estimated that only
about 15% were not known commercial or backyard breeders.</p>

<p>Remember that establishments that produce large numbers of pups are much more likely to advertise
than high-quality show breeders, who often have waiting lists for their pups, so any ad should really
be viewed with caution. That doesn't mean that everyone who advertises is an inexperienced breeder, a
backyard breeder, or a puppy mill. It does mean that you need to do your homework and check any breeder
thoroughly before you buy a puppy (see below for how to do that). We recommend never buying a puppy
from a kennel you have not visited personally. Ordering a puppy off the internet and having the puppy
arrive via air freight is not the way to go.</p>

<p>But there are good breeders out there. Here are some places to start to find a responsible breeder.</p>

<h5>Dog shows</h5>
<p>A dog show is a great place to find good breeders. You can see some of the breeders
dogs and, at a benched show, talk to the breeder to see whether he or she might have the dog you
are looking for. In general, show breeders know what they are doing, and their primary concern is in improving the breed.</p>

<h5>Breed-specific bulletin boards on the internet</h5>
<p>Breeders and people who know good breeders
often post regularly on bulletin boards. Do a search for the breed you want, then log on to a
lively site and post a message stating that you are looking for a responsible breeder of the kind
of dog you have in mind. </p>

<p>The more sources you investigate, the better your chances of finding a reputable breeder.</p>
