  <h1>Understanding Dog Behavior</h1>
  </br>
  <p>Communication begins with understanding. If you want
  to build a better relationship with your dog, you can start by working
  to understand the meaning and causes behind some of her most common dog behaviors.</p>
  </br>
<h4>Common Dog Behaviors and What They Mean</h4>
<h5>Panting</h5>
<p>Because dogs sweat through the pads on their feet, most of their body heat
is expelled through their mouth when they pant. It is their primary means of regulating body temperature.</p>
<h5>Dog Barking</h5>
<p>In nature, dogs bark to raise an alarm at the first signs of possible danger
or to herald a new arrival. Barking is an important means of canine communication. See What
Your Dog's Bark is Telling You.</p>
<h5>Dog Chewing</h5>
<p>Just as a growing child, your dog will want to chew on toys and other objects
to relieve the pain of a new set of teeth coming in. If your dog is full grown, you may also
come home to find your couch cushions or favorite pair of shoes ripped to shreds, but it is not
because they enjoy the taste. Your dog could be exhibiting signs of separation anxiety or anxiety
in general.</p>
<h5>Digging</h5>
<p>Digging is an instinctual activity, written deep in a dog's DNA. It is especially
strong in terrier breeds. Dogs in natural packs will dig to hide food or to uncover
food such as small rodents. A den dug in the cool earth can also provide shelter from the heat.</p>

<h5>Jumping up</h5>
<p>Though it may seem like play behavior, or an enthusiastic greeting, jumping up is a
sign that your dog is attempting to assert her dominance over you. By encouraging jumping up with affection,
you are reinforcing the behavior.</p>
<h5>Dog Biting</h5>
<p>A dog will bite a person as a way of communicating their current state of mind. The
dog could be reacting in aggression, fear or nervousness. There are, however, ways to prevent a dog bite
from ever happening if you stay in tune to the dogâ€™s body language. </p>
<h5>Separation anxiety</h5>
<p>Dogs live and travel in packs, so it's natural for them to feel anxious when they are
separated from their pack-mates. Try taking your dog on a nice, long walk before leaving her alone in the house.
Leaving her in resting mode can calm her anxiety.</p>
</br>
<p>Once you understand these behaviors, you'll be better equipped to recognize when your
pack's needs are not being met! When your dog's needs go unfulfilled, unwanted behaviors begin to emerge.
Consider: Are you giving Exercise, Discipline, then Affection?</p>
