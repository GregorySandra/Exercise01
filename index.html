  <h4>Description:</h4>

<p>
    The German Shepherd Dog is well proportioned and very strong.
The GSD has a sturdy, muscular, slightly elongated body with a light,
solid bone structure. The head should be in proportion to its body,
and the forehead a little rounded. The nose is most often black, however,
blue or liver still do sometimes occur, but are considered a fault and cannot be shown.
The teeth meet in a strong scissors bite. The dark eyes are almond-shaped, and never protruding.
The ears are wide at the base, pointed, upright and turned forward.
The ears of puppies under six months may droop slightly.
The bushy tail reaches below the hocks and hangs down when the dog is at rest.
The front legs and shoulders are muscular and the thighs are thick and sturdy.
The round feet have very hard soles. There are three varieties of the German Shepherd: double coat,
plush coat and longhaired coat. The coat most often comes in black with tan,
sable or all black, but also can come in blue, liver and white,
but those colors are considered a fault according to most standards.
White is not an acceptable color for the German Shepherd, however they are now being recognized as a separate breed,
called the American White Shepherd. A piebald color has also occurred
in a single GSD bloodline that is now being called Panda Shepherds.
A Panda is 35% white the remainder of color is black and tan, and has no white German Shepherds in its ancestry.

    Often used as working dogs, German Shepherds are courageous,
    keen, alert and fearless. Cheerful, obedient and eager to learn. Tranquil, confident,
    serious and clever. GSDs are extremely faithful, and brave. They will not think twice about
    giving their lives for their human pack. They have a high learning ability. German Shepherds
    love to be close to their families, but can be wary of strangers. This breed needs his people
    and should not be left isolated for long periods of time. They only bark when they feel it
    is necessary. Often used as police dogs, the German Shepherd has a very strong protective instinct,
    and is extremely loyal to its handler. Socialize this breed well starting at puppyhood. Aggression and
    attacks on people are due to poor handling and training. Problems arise when an owner allows the dog to
    believe he is pack leader over humans and/or does not give the dog the mental and physical daily
    exercise it needs to be stable. This breed needs owners who are naturally authoritative over the
    dog in a calm, but firm, confident and consistent way. A stable, well-adjusted, and trained dog
    is for the most part generally good with other pets and excellent with children in the family.
    They must be firmly trained in obedience from an early age. German Shepherds with passive owners
    and/or whose instincts are not being met can become timid, skittish and may be prone to fear
    biting and develop a guarding issue. They should be trained and socialized from an early age.
    German Shepherds will not listen if they sense that they are stronger minded than their owner,
    however they will also not respond well to harsh discipline. Owners need to have an air of
    natural authority to their demeanor. Do not treat this dog as if he were human. Learn canine
    instincts and treat the dog accordingly. German Shepherds are one of the smartest and most
    trainable breeds. With this highly skilled working dog comes a drive to have a job and a task
    in life and a consistent pack leader to show them guidance. They need somewhere to channel their
    mental and physical energy. This is not a breed that will be happy simply lying around your
    living room or locked out in the backyard. The breed is so intelligent and learns so readily
    that it has been used as a sheepdog, guard dog, in police work, as a guide for the blind, i
    n search and rescue service, and in the military. The German Shepherd also excels in many
    other dog activities including Schutzhund, tracking, obedience, agility, flyball and ring
    sport. His fine nose can sniff out drugs and intruders, and can alert handlers to the
    presence of underground mines in time to avoid detonation, or gas leaks in a pipe buried
    15 feet underground. The German Shepherd is also a popular show and family companion.
